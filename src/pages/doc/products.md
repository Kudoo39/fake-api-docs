## Pagination

APIs that use offset-based paging use the offset and limit query parameters to paginate through items in a collection.

Offset-based pagination is often used where the list of items is of a fixed and predetermined length.

To fetch the first page of entries in a collection, the API needs to be called with the `offset` set to 0 and with the `limit` the products that you want in the response.

```bash
[GET] https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products?offset=0&limit=10
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Handmade Fresh Table",
    "price": 687,
    "description": "Andy shoes are designed to keeping in...",
    "category": {
      "id": 5,
      "name": "Others",
      "image": "https://placeimg.com/640/480/any?r=0.591926261873231"
    },
    "images": [
      "https://placeimg.com/640/480/any?r=0.9178516507833767",
      "https://placeimg.com/640/480/any?r=0.9300320592588625",
      "https://placeimg.com/640/480/any?r=0.8807778235430017"
    ]
  }
  // ... and 9 items more
]
```

To fetch the **next page** of entries, the API needs to be called with an offset parameter that equals the sum of the previous offset value and limit returned to the previous result, `previous_offset + previous_limit`.

```bash
[GET] https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products?offset=10&limit=10
```

> Note that the offset should be increased by the previous limit and not by the size of the entries in the response array, as this may be less than the limit. Generally we advise using the value of the limit in the response object to increase the offset value.

For example, for a pagination with 10 items per page, it looks like this:

<!-- ```bash
[GET] http://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products?offset=0&limit=10
[GET] http://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products?offset=10&limit=10
[GET] http://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products?offset=20&limit=10
``` -->
